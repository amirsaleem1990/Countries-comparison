The agencies issued a statement in October in which they said community banks and credit unions could pool compliance resources.\n\nRegulators will continue to engage with the private sector on innovation, the statement said.

As the world welcomed in 2018, Europe saw the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) come into force. And later this year, it’s the turn of the Cayman Islands, with a final deadline for the revised Proceeds of Crime Law landing on 31 December.\n\nThe revised Law has broadened the scope of entities that are subject to the Cayman Islands’ anti-money laundering (AML) laws and regulations. It now goes beyond traditional financial service providers to include entities that are ‘investing, administering or managing funds or money on behalf of other persons’, and those carrying out the ‘underwriting and placement of life insurance and other investment-related insurance’.\n\nThis change means that all regulated funds – those registered or licensed with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) – as well as unregulated investment entities, such as private equity, venture capital and real estate funds, are caught in the AML regulatory net. Certain structured finance vehicles whose activities weren’t previously covered by the definition of Relevant Financial Business now fall under the new Law.\n\nThe AML regulations require in-scope entities to designate a natural person for three positions: an anti-money laundering compliance officer (AMLCO), a money laundering reporting officer (MLRO), and a deputy money laundering reporting officer (DMLRO) (the Officers). All Officers must, unsurprisingly, have the adequate knowledge and expertise to perform the function.\n\nRoles defined\n\nSo what exactly do these three roles entail?\n\nFirstly, the AMLCO will be responsible for: ensuring the entity implements the measures outlined in the AML regulations, covering both the funds investor and investment processes; be the point of contact with the competent authorities; and report to and advise the board of compliance matters requiring their attention for the purpose of the regulations.\n\nThe MLRO and the DMLRO are charged with processing suspicious activity reports, with responsibilities to provide notification of their appointment to delegated parties; to assess, process and report suspicious activity reports as required; and to handle reports immediately on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe AMLCO can also act as either MLRO or DMLRO, but the MLRO and DMLRO must be two separate people. Funds can delegate these roles to employees of their administrator, investment manager, board members or other service providers.\n\nNext steps\n\nRegulated funds need to notify CIMA of the appointed Officers through the CIMA REEFS portal, before 31 December 2018.

In recent times, the SBP has become more aggressive about enforcing the rules on both banks and exchange companies, as foreign currency dealers, to remove concerns of Financial Action Task Force about anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing. The SBP’s Banking Policy and Regulations Group called the chief executives of exchange companies on November 28 to discuss efforts being made to implement revised national risk assessment (NRA) on terrorist financing and targeted financial sanctions.\n\nIn the meeting, important matters related to AML and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements and management of exchange companies were discussed in detail, the circular said.

It considered that Malta failed to correctly supervise financial institutions and ensure their compliance with anti-money laundering rules.\n\nBuilding on the recommendation of European Banking Authority and acknowledging the measures adopted by Malta to address the identified shortcomings in the meantime, the European Commission adopted today a formal opinion on the basis of the EBA regulation. The opinion requires the Maltese anti-money laundering supervisor (Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit) to take additional measures to fully comply with its obligation under the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive to effectively supervise financial institutions on its territory, including by having an effective sanctioning regime.\n\nFirst Vice-President Frans Timmermans said: \"To protect the security of Europeans and ensure a safe, reliable financial system, every authority in every Member State must uphold EU money-laundering rules in full. We remain vigilant and ready to act so that any breach is swiftly remedied and that better supervisory practice ensures it does not happen again.\"\n\nCommission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said: “We need to ensure that money laundering and terrorist financing risks in the financial sector are properly assessed and mitigated by our supervisory authorities. The European Banking Authority contributes to a harmonised application of anti-money laundering supervisory rules. Our September proposal will equip the EBA with the additional instruments and resources needed to ensure effective cooperation and convergence of supervisory standards. I count on the European Parliament and Councils cooperation to turn this proposal into legislation rapidly.”\n\nCommissioner for Justice, Gender Equality and Consumers, Vera Jourová, added:” Europe has the strongest anti-money laundering rules in the world. But they need to be enforced with the same high standards across the EU to avoid creating any weak link. Malta and other countries must have well equipped authorities and fully implemented rules in place. The Commission will use all its powers, including infringement procedures, to close any loopholes in the fight against money laundering.”\n\nMore concretely, the European Commission calls upon Maltas Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit to take a number of measures, which include:\n\nImproving its methodology to assess money laundering and terrorist financing risks;\n\nEnhancing its monitoring and supervisory strategy by aligning resources with the risk of money laundering posed by certain institutions;\n\nEnsuring that the authority is able to react in an appropriate time when a weakness is identified, including by revising its sanctioning procedures;\n\nEnsuring that its decision-making is properly reasoned and documented;\n\nAdopting systematic and detailed record-keeping processes for offsite inspections.\n\nImproving the implementation of EU anti-money laundering rules across the EU\n\nThe fight against money-laundering and terrorist financing is a priority for the Juncker Commission. The Commission is using all tools at its disposal to make sure that the high European standards are applied in practice across the EU.\n\nIn this case, the Commission used for the first time its power to request the European Banking Authority to investigate potential breaches of Union law by an authority of a Member State. The Commission has since also requested the European Banking Authority to conduct an enquiry on the competent authorities in Latvia, Denmark and Estonia, where recent cases have raised concerns about the effective enforcement of the anti-money laundering rules by national authorities. The European Banking Authority plays an important role in promoting convergence of supervisory practices to ensure a harmonised application of anti-money laundering supervision rules.\n\nIn order to address the remaining gaps in the current legal framework at European level, the Commission adopted on 12 September 2018 a Communication and a proposal to further strengthen the EBAs mandate to better address money laundering risks and to improve the cooperation and sharing of information between the supervisory authorities. This proposal needs to be adopted by the co-legislators as a priority.\n\nThe adoption of the fourth and the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directives has considerably strengthened the EU regulatory framework, including rules on cooperation between anti-money laundering and prudential supervisors. The Commission is closely following the correct implementation of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive including through infringement procedures where necessary. The Commission has opened, so far, infringement procedures for non-communication of transposition measures on the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive against 21 Member States: three are currently at the stage of court referrals (Romania, Ireland and Luxembourg), with one on hold (Greece), nine at the stage of Reasoned Opinions, and eight at the stage of Letters of Formal Notice.\n\nNext steps\n\nMaltas Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit has ten working days upon receipt of the opinion to inform the Commission and the European Banking Authority of the measures it intends to take to comply with their obligations. This process under the EBA Regulation is separate from and without prejudice to the Commissions prerogative of launching an infringement procedure against Malta.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EBA Regulation (article 17 (4)) gives the European Commission the power to issue a formal opinion requiring the national authority, in charge of implementing anti-money laundering rules in the financial sector, to take action to fully comply with Union law, where it has failed to do so. The Commissions formal opinion takes into account the EBAs recommendation.\n\nUnder this procedure, the Commission had sent a letter to the European Banking Authority in October 2017, asking it to ensure that institutions responsible for supervision of the anti-money laundering framework established in Malta, satisfied the requirements of the EU Anti-Money Laundering legislation. The European Banking Authority carried out a preliminary investigation, including an onsite visit at the relevant Maltese institutions. On 11 July 2018, the EBA decided that the Maltese authority (FIAU) was indeed in breach of Union law and adopted a formal recommendation to the authority. It is the first time that the EBA issued a breach of Union law recommendation in the area of money-laundering.\n\nFor More Information\n\nCommission opinion addressed to the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit of Malta\n\nAnti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing\n\nEBA Recommendation\n\nInfringements against Member States on the implementation of the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive',127,1.00,'The European Commission has adopted today an opinion requiring the Maltese anti-money laundering supervisor (Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit) to continue taking additional measures to fully comply with its obligations under the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.\nIt considered that Malta failed to correctly supervise financial institutions and ensure their compliance with anti-money laundering rules.\nThe European Banking Authority contributes to a harmonised application of anti-money laundering supervisory rules.\nThe adoption of the fourth and the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directives has considerably strengthened the EU regulatory framework, including rules on cooperation between anti-money laundering and prudential supervisors.\nThe European Banking Authority carried out a preliminary investigation, including an onsite visit at the relevant Maltese institutions.',1057,475,0),('Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Finance Fayval Williams says Jamaica will intensify its efforts to bolster its Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism regime (AML/CFT).\n\nSpeaking at the plenary Caribbean Action Financial Task Force (CFATF) in Barbados earlier this week, Williams, a stout advocate of the AML/CFT Framework, expressed that it is imperative that Jamaica’s legislative and institutional framework is in full compliance with the Financial Action Task Force 40 Recommendations by 2020.\n\n“This timeline is important to ensure that the country is not named as a country with strategic deficiencies and therefore subject to countermeasures by other countries,” Williams said.\n\nShe highlighted that the global financial system is uncompromising in this requirement for all countries to have a strong AML/CFT system.

As a result of this record-breaking fine, shockwaves were sent throughout Taiwan to official circles, at the same time legislators were considering new regulations to combat financial crimes. Although the fine imposed on Mega Bank was considered to be excessive, Yu Li-Chen, executive secretary of the government’s anti-money laundering office said: “it really was a blessing in disguise”.\n\n\n\nFear of a similar scandal has pushed lawmakers to pass a stronger framework which was implemented in June of 2017. This has allowed for financial institutions across Taipei, to reassess their Anti-Money Laundering procedures, ensuring that they are now able to pass the revised law as it stands. This framework is currently being evaluated by the Asia Pacific Group (APG) on Money Laundering. A favourable assessment by APG will guarantee Taiwan’s Status as one of the best jurisdictions for anti-money laundering rules, alongside Macau and Indonesia. Last year’s previous round of reviews, raised Taiwan’s ranking from one of the worst AML compliant countries to one of the most compliant countries in the world.\n\nDuring the course of the two-week appraisal, APG’s evaluators interviewed 16 representatives, chosen from among Taiwan’s financial institutions such as lawyers, accountants, real estate agents, financial regulators and the coast guard. Results are expected to be released soon. Being listed as a non-compliant country can negatively affect the economic growth of the country due to the sanctions that are levied against it. Taiwan’s Government has responded to this by tightening regulations over the past two years, in order to prevent sanctions being imposed on their own country.\n\n\n\nThe Mega Bank fine provided a wake-up call to all financial companies and officials who had fallen into a “box-checking culture”. Evidence of this can be seen in the decrease in the number of AML cases from 2017 – 2018. In 2017 there were 277 Cases equating to $1 million USD worth of fines this then dropped to 254 cases in 2018 worth $162,000 USD.\n\nHeightened Know-Your-Customer laws, has meant that firms need to cut ties with long-standing clients who were unwilling or unable to comply with the new rules and regulations. Stricter procedures have also affected banking customers as it now takes two forms of identification and a specified purpose to open a personal Bank account. The FSC (Financial Supervisory Commission) is in the process of mandating checks on all transactions over $16,000 USD.\n\n\n\nPoliticians have also been caught up with the new regulatory changes, they now have to deal with more paperwork when conducting business with their own banking. PWC Taiwan helped institutions prepare for the evaluation, however, they have predicted that it could take two to three years to build up the necessary data to establish usable customer risk profiles. Miaojung Lin & Samson Ellis from Bloomberg said that these new AML processes have “forced Taiwanese Companies to get to grip with these new rules faster and in more detail than some other” countries.

The risk is therefore high that the casino may have been used for money laundering.” Casino Cosmopol operates gaming venues in four cities; Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö and Sundsvall.\n\nThe areas of concern included the company’s risk-based routines, business relations and customer awareness measures, the obligation to deny transactions and keeping accurate documentation.\n\nFor one thing, all video surveillance footage at the casinos was automatically deleted after seven days, making it difficult to track individual gamblers’ activity. Casino Cosmopol also makes over half its revenue from slot machines, but the regulator claims the company doesn’t assign staff to monitor slots play like they do for table game activity.\n\nThe regulator also challenged the company’s assessment that only 0.3% of its customers were either medium- or high-risks for money laundering. The regulator noted that a customer who had been referred to financial authorities three times for suspected money laundering was assessed as a low risk for money laundering by Casino Cosmopol.\n\nThe company was also found to have justified one customer’s high spending due to the customer operating a restaurant that handled SEK12m in annual sales. However, the regulator said the company should have judged this customer’s spending ability by his taxable income rather than his restaurant’s turnover, particularly given that operation’s “cash-intensive activities.”\n\nLotteriinspektionen noted that Casino Cosmopol had applied for a new license under Sweden’s newly regulated gambling market that takes effect on January 1, 2019.

The objective? Creating a safer, more robust and more transparent financial system.\n\nLevel of Fines at a Distant Second to the USA\n\nEurope accounts for 7% of global AML fines levied in the last 10 years, totalling over $1.7 billion across 83 separate fines, with 17 regulators across 15 countries. There’s evidence that the level of fines is starting to slow. According to Laura Glynn, Fenergo’s Director of Regulatory Compliance, the number of fines is beginning to plateau globally after a very busy decade. However, the monetary amount of each fine is increasing for the more significant breaches and infringements. Despite this global decline, the European market was an outlier in 2018 with total fines of $903m, driven by the Dutch market issuing the highest fine in the past decade.\n\nA Spotlight on European Enforcement Activity\n\nUK - Dominating European Issued Fines\n\nThe UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) dominates European fines, accounting for more than 30% of European AML/KYC/Sanctions fines issued over the past decade. Considering that over $90 billion is laundered annually through financial institutions under their remit, the regulator is pioneering an aggressive agenda of cultural change, evidenced by the implementation of a revised regime for individual accountability in the financial sector, namely the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR).\n\nNetherlands – Record-Breaking Fines\n\nDutch financial crime prosecutors handed out a record European fine for the past ten years, totalling $900m, in a joint investigation with US authorities. A recent change to legislation allows regulators to impose turnover-related administrative fines for significant AML breaches to 20%.\n\nSwitzerland – Under Pressure\n\nSwitzerland’s position as a secretive offshore financial haven puts it under international scrutiny. Despite levying only 4 fines totalling $51m in the past decade, international regulators have imposed 12 fines worth over $675m for a range of violations including AML and tax evasion.\n\nLuxembourg – A Change in Approach\n\nAfter many years of a reticent enforcement approach, 2017 saw a shift with two heavy penalties totalling $14m against two institutions. This is overshadowed by internationally-led penalties of $152m against Luxembourg’s financial institutions.\n\nNordics – Increasing AML Focus\n\nDenmark and Sweden have sanctioned and fined five leading financial institutions for AML violations and offences over five years amounting to $17.2m in punitive fines. In total, $1.5m was levied on Nordic financial institutions by international financial regulators. This makes it the only region in the world where Nordic banks have been fined by domestic regulators more than by international regulators. It is expected that big changes may arise in this region with current investigations against Nordic banks taking place across Denmark, Estonia, US and the UK.\n\nThe Changing Face of Regulatory Enforcement\n\nWith the implementation of new regulations, including MiFID II and GDPR over the past year alone, we can expect to see European regulators continue to flex their enforcement muscles.\n\nFor financial institutions, compliance and the rate of regulatory change will continue to be a main concern but as the industry moves beyond mere survival mode to double-digit growth, the new battleground is client experience.

What is an obviously fictitious name?” asked Mr Ng.\n\nIn response, Mr Wong said that the phrasing was “deliberately done” to give businesses the flexibility to develop procedures according their own considerations, including business size and customer profile.\n\nMr Ng also expressed hope that this was not just another “tick in the box exercise”.\n\n“We must remember that we are asking developers who are there to make a profit to do their due diligence which might end up with them making less profits. We are asking them to check on their own clients who are paying them and at times paying them a lot of money,” said Mr Ng.\n\nMP Lee Bee Wah speaks in Parliament on 20 Nov 2018.\n\nNee Soon GRC MP Dr Lee Bee Wah also stressed that the government needs to engage the \"right people with the relevant know-how\" and work closely with them to ensure the new legislation will not end up “just another paper exercise and form signing”.\n\nIn response, Mr Wong stressed that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) will help developers “level up” through their industry outreach and provide all the necessary guidance in the initial implementation stage.\n\n“Subsequently, URA will provide ongoing support to improve the industry’s understanding of what constitutes risky transactions, as well as their risk mitigation capabilities that are needed, in order to foster a good understanding of the new requirements,” Mr Wong added.\n\n“We would like to strike a balance between complying with the requirements recommended by the FATF and ensuring that the burden on developers is not excessive,” he added.\n\nBEING TOO “HEAVY-HANDED”?\n\nAnswering a question from MP Gan Thiam Poh, who had asked when the duty and responsibility of the developer ends, Mr Wong stressed that developers would not be required to monitor their buyers “perpetually”.\n\n“The rules will make clear that the requirements on developers will only apply until the project is completed, which is also the point at which the developer is no longer regulated under the two Acts,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Lee also warned against “overreacting and being too heavy-handed” in the proposed regulations and duties for developers.\n\n“If we look at the existing policies, the risk of transactions being abused for money-laundering and terrorism funding activities is frankly not very high,’ she said. “Hence, I do not see the point of burdening the developers with additional requirements, that may or may not serve the purpose of mitigating (money laundering or terrorism financing).\"\n\nShe added that the sales transactions already including documents and payments that have to be handled by financial institutions.\n\n“Developers are secondary recipients of funds and the (money laundering/financing terrorism) risks faced by developers are lower,” she added.\n\nWhile Mr Wong agreed that most money laundering and terrorism financing activities are generally concentrated in the financial sectors, he added that real estate is also an \"established method of money-laundering worldwide\".\n\n“For the real estate sector in particular, beside your bankers and lawyers, developers are a key party that deal with property buyers,” he added.\n\n“So they do play an important role in the detection and prevention of such activities and that’s why we are introducing these requirements by amending the two acts that regulate developers to better facilitate our anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing activities.”',145,0.00,'SINGAPORE: The Government has put in place new anti-money laundering and terrorism financing requirements for property developers that will require them to perform due diligence checks on their buyers and flag suspicious activity.\nThe new rules come after Parliament passed the Developers (Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Bill on Tuesday (Nov 20).\n“The Bill adopts a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering and terrorism financing compliance,” he added.\nThese changes will bring Singapore’s anti-money laundering and terrorism financing regime in line with the international standards set out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), said Mr Wong.\n“This Bill is important as it allows Singapore to more effectively combat money laundering and terrorism financing,” said Mr Wong.',1090,486,0),('MANILA -

As part of this initiative, FinCEN will engage in outreach efforts that include “dedicated times for financial institutions, technology providers and other firms involved in financial services innovations to discuss the implications of their products and services, and their future applications or next steps.” Each of the aforementioned agencies has established, or will establish, projects or offices that will work to support the implementation of responsible innovation and new technology in the financial system.\n\nAs for those banks that opt out of these efforts, the agencies said jointly, they “will not penalize or criticize banks” that do not pursue such innovation but demonstrate continued compliance.\n\nSenate Hearing on AML\n\nLate last week, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on updating the Bank Secrecy Act’s anti-money laundering requirements.\n\nAt that hearing, as reported by Credit Union Times, smaller financial institutions, including credit unions, said the laws should take into account regulatory burdens and emerging technology.\n\nThe recommendations came from a number of trade groups, said the publication.\n\n“Credit unions take BSA/AML compliance seriously and dedicate significant resources to it,” CUNA President/CEO Jim Nussle wrote in a letter to the congressional committee. “However, when credit unions are spending their limited resources disproportionately on compliance, this means they are spending fewer resources on innovating and providing safe and affordable products and services.”\n\nNussle said that Congress should look to minimize duplication of information and increase the threshold of currency transaction reporting, among other recommendations.\n\nIn a separate missive to the committee, Brad Thaler, who serves as vice president of legislative affairs at the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, wrote that the federal agency known as the National Credit Union Administration should “support flexibility in carrying out this important function to ensure that necessary and vital reporting continues and credit union staff may be protected from civil liability.”\n\nPer the hearing, Republican Mike Crapo of Idaho, who chairs the committee, stated that “while not yet settled on any one particular reform or fix, members of the committee are united on the idea that there is room for change in a decades-old system that will yield a modernized BSA anti-money laundering regime that works for law enforcement, financial institutions, their regulators and the man on the street, who is the ultimate beneficiary of a strong U.S. financial system.”\n\nAs noted by Credit Union Times, there was some discussion over how relaxed rules should be for smaller financial institutions. Said Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, such relaxing of rules could be harmful.\n\n“Money launderers are looking for the weakest link, whether it is HSBC or BB&T or Lone Star National Bank, and will migrate to smaller banks as necessary to hide their crimes,” Brown said, as quoted by the site. “Community and regional banks play a crucial role alongside our biggest banks in monitoring transactions across the country.”\n\nIn other testimony, Kenneth Blanco, director of FinCEN, stated that the rules in place are indeed working, and that any changes must be carefully considered when it comes to battling financial corruption.\n\n“While we are eager to improve and reform the BSA framework, we believe it is important to ensure that any change is supported by such an assessment and a clearer understanding of how to measure the effectiveness of BSA data,” he said, as quoted by Credit Union Times.',152,1.00,'The agencies tied to the joint release include the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the National Credit Union Administration and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\nIn terms of future efforts, FinCEN said it is launching an innovation initiative to foster a better understanding of BSA/AML-related innovation in the financial services sector.\nSenate Hearing on AMLLate last week, the Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on updating the Bank Secrecy Act’s anti-money laundering requirements.\nAt that hearing, as reported by Credit Union Times, smaller financial institutions, including credit unions, said the laws should take into account regulatory burdens and emerging technology.\n“Credit unions take BSA/AML compliance seriously and dedicate significant resources to it,” CUNA President/CEO Jim Nussle wrote in a letter to the congressional committee.',864,489,0),('/latest/2018/11/canada-presents-three-possible-cryptocurrency-regulations-in-anti-money-laundering-committee/\n\nCanada Presents Three Possible Cryptocurrency Regulations In Anti-Money Laundering Committee\n\ncanada-presents-three-possible-cryptocurrency-regulations-in-anti-money-laundering-committee\n\nEarlier this week, the Canadian House Finance Committee met and discussed the role of cryptocurrencies. As part of their regular meetings as required by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), cryptocurrencies became a hot topic, as regulators see them as an easy way to launder money.\n\nThe usual reasons, according to iPolitics, came up: cryptocurrencies are anonymous, difficult to trace, and have a history of being used by risky personalities such as Edward Snowden and Julian Assange.\n\nThe purpose of these committee meetings is to review and assess actions and plans for the PCMLTFA. During these talks, 70 expert witnesses from finance came spoke. In addition, financial adviser IJW & Co. and law firm Durand Morisseau LLP, submitted a 56-page joint brief, outlining the role of cryptocurrencies. They explained that:\n\nIn the absence of some degree of regulatory oversight, cryptocurrency transactions may be used by parties to swiftly move large amounts of wealth across borders, and that regulating (exchanges of fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies) would address the (anti-money-laundering) concerns of the cryptocurrency space.\n\nAs a result of these committee meetings, the Canadian House Finance Committee outlined three possibilities for how they will regulate the cryptocurrency space.\n\nRequire fiat-to-crypto exchanges to register as money service businesses. This would place them under the extensive compliance laws of PCMLTFA, and help insure user’s funds. Create a national license for cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Canada. Similar to New York State’s BitLicense, this license would only be offered to exchanges that pass through rigorous screening and background checks. Regulate cryptocurrency wallet companies, so that any suspicious or unlawful transactions can be tracked or monitored by regulators.\n\nThese are not official laws yet, but these suggestions hint at what direction regulators will take when regulations do come out.

The decision does not categorically state who are liable, and the 5th division does not want to go beyond the text of the decision.\n\nBut according to Revillas lawyer Rean Balisi, the former senator should not be required to pay based on Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nArticle 100 states that \"every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly liable.\" Revilla was acquitted of the criminal charge of plunder, and therefore, according to Balisi, not civilly liable.\n\nThis clarifies an earlier statement by Revillas other lawyer Ramon Esguerra who told reporters right after the hearing: \"There is a part of the judgment ordering all the 3 accused, including the senator, to return P124 million more or less.

But this time, it is unprecedented situation, as the decision makers are straining every nerve to seek some benign remedy before taking the ‘bitter pill’ with side effects.\n\nThe PTI government has been greeted with adverse economic indicators like external debt of US $ 96 billion, debt to GDP ratio of 6.20%, current account deficit extending to US $ 18 billion as imports for Chinese financed projects far exceed exports, circular debt accumulating to Rs.1.2 trillion, fiscal deficit hiking to 6.6% of GDP and the dwindling foreign exchange reserve at around US $ 8 billion.\n\nThese chronic economic conditions have every time forced the successive governments to resort to the international lender International Monetary Fund. The incumbent regime was also in dire need of US $ 12 billion to get through economic woes but it opted out to seek financial help from the friendly states first. Consequently, Saudi Arabia directly transferred US $ 3 billion in SBP to improve balance of payment position besides committing US $ 3 billion deferred payment facility to facilitate oil imports. Similar sort of relief from China is also in process. These arrangements have, reportedly, scaled down requirement of Pakistan to over US $8 billion from IMF, as its 13th bailout since 1980s.\n\nLast round of talks with the IMF delegation concluded on November 20 that witnessed a stalemate over the tough conditionalities. IMF has been reported to propose very tough conditions like addition to electricity tariff, hike in interest rate, rise in tax revenue targets, a definite plan to permanently clear circular debt of power sector, assigning authority to an independent power regulator to set electricity tariff and disclosure by Pakistan about Chinese financial relief. The IMF officials have also been reported to be critical over the prevailing fiscal federalism whereby the lucrative taxes have been transferred to the provinces. It has also suggested an entire market based free floated exchange rate system without any intervention of the SBP. Finance Ministry has acknowledged that the sides are still at odds over certain issues. As usual, IMF expects more than the new government has the leverage to manage.\n\nStill, the Finance Ministry claims that a considerable progress has been made by the government of Pakistan and the IMF towards common understanding on structural reform framework. Therefore, some positive outcome can be anticipated.\n\nHowever, in order to stage a real farewell to IMF, the present government must carry out the following structural initiatives to achieve long term economic stabilization:\n\n1. Tax revenue system should be modernized by widening the tax base, including the ‘holy cows’ in tax net and arresting tax corruption.\n\n2. Arrangements of fiscal federalism must be balanced.\n\n3. The government can learn from Malaysia how public enterprises were run successfully by putting them under a holding company to eliminate all losses & governance issues.\n\n4. In order to attract maximum foreign direct investment, ‘ease for doing business’ must be institutionalized.\n\n5. Momentum for crusade against corruption should be increased. The upcoming ‘Whistle Blowing Act’ could be handy in this regard.\n\n6. Keeping in view the current national issues, legislation for anti-money laundering and combating terrorism financing must be revised/revisited. It is also essential to tackle FATF proceedings.\n\n7. Foreign remittances should be promoted by eradicating hundi and hawala. This would directly boost our foreign exchange reserves.\n\n8. A comprehensive export strategy is required to be established by removing all pre-shipment and post-shipment difficulties.\n\n9. The government must foster the economic inclusion of the youth, women and the poor in order to maximize the gross domestic product.\n\n10. Policies must be focused on a growth path that is characterized by sustainable job creation.\n\nA visionary leadership is at the helm of our country that can foresee the dividends of a robust economy.

Not to mentions all the hidden fees and rules that sometimes would apply for different reasons.\n\nBut that’s no longer the case – or, at least, there is a choice to avoid the traditional system. The finance world is transforming – and there are alternative finance platforms for investors who want to make their money grow, without the inconveniences that are usually found in the traditional financial institutions.\n\nAccording to Investopedia : “An alternative investment is an asset that is not one of the conventional investment types, such as stocks, bonds, and cash.” Alternative finance platforms usually use technology solutions to make the financial process more efficient and accessible for everyone from an experienced trader with a lot of assets to a simple person which has an only small sum to invest. It allows more people to use financial instruments to improve their life quality.\n\nAlternative investment platforms may be different from one another, some of them offer investment in real estate, P2P lending, consumer loans, businesses, startups, etc. It usually brings better ROI than conservative investments which yields up to 4% ROI annually, while alternative investment can grow the return on investment up to 16% and more. Higher return on investment means bigger risk, that is why platforms constantly work on solutions to lower all the possible risks. During the past years, alternative investment companies had a huge improvement in risk management practices. Most of them are following strict Know Your Customer & Anti Money Laundering best practices. Platforms do in-depth quality checks in all the investment proposals before listing it to their customers. At the same time, newest technologies lower the risk of fraudulent activities.\n\nEach year alternative investment platforms grow, matures and gain more influence in the finance world. A rising star in the market at the moment is Fast Invest. They are developing a peer to peer investment platform based on investments in already issued consumer loans across Europe. The company strives to offer a way for everyone to invest their money and build a passive income flow.\n\nFast Invest experienced rapid growth compared to 2017, according to 2018 3rd quarter results, platform reached 27k customers. Their average interest rate increased from 12.78% to 14.3%. Company cumulative turnover grew from € 5.2 mln. to more than €29.6 mln. As well investment volume rose from €1.3 mln. to more than €5.2mln.\n\nWhy people choose Fast Invest?\n\nThere are unique features which helps them to stand out from a wide range of competitors and attract more investors each month.\n\nSecurity, all loans in Fast Invest pool are protected by a Default Guarantee. It is evident that all investments carry some risks. There is a possibility that the borrower will stop paying his repayments for multiple reasons. Fast Invest is making sure that their customer’s investment would be safe by compensating the payment if a borrower is ever late on his or her scheduled loan payment. If a payment instalment is overdue for just three days or more, Fast Invest Default Guarantee will settle any amounts in arrears.\n\nMoney back, anytime. Fast Invest constantly works to develop a platform that offers the highest quality services to their customers. That is why the platform offers a different BuyBack Guarantee than investors are used to. If anyone decides to stop investing at any loan, Fast Invest will buy the investment back in one day, compared to 30-60 days in other similar companies. Investors do not need to worry about their assets for a month or two anymore. They can receive the funds immediately. As well by establishing this guarantee, they have eliminated the need of the secondary market. In this way investors do not need to worry about the slow money liquidity anymore, they can get it back their assets anytime.\n\nOne of the highest ROI in the market. Fast Invest peer to peer investment platform offers interest rates from 9% up to 16%. According to their 2018 3rd quarter results, investors received an average 14,3% return on their investment compared to 12.78% in 2017. The positive increase was possible because of excellent management, strategic partnerships, and top-end technological solutions.

They have successfully lowered the investment risks so that everyone would have a chance to be an investor. The success that the platform faces is no coincidence. It is purely a result of the hard work that CEO S. Vaitkune and her team put into the development of the platform. They will continue to disrupt the investment industry by providing high-quality services to their customers.\n\nWhile individual investment companies like Fast Invest are doing great, whole alternative investment market is rapidly expanding.

Analysts estimate that AI will save the banking industry more than $1 trillion by 2030.\n\nI have been talking with bank executives for the last couple of years and it is exciting to hear that the banking industry has started to seriously consider artificial intelligence-based solutions for many traditional banking problems. The use cases where executives are seeing value do vary based on size, location and the type of financial institution. However, some core attributes remain the same.\n\nFor example, large banks have a huge customer success burden, so they naturally look toward automation of customer service with chatbots. Financial institutions like hedge funds are chasing alpha with AI on top of new layers of data sources, and insurance companies are improving risk models with AI. On the other hand, many of the financial institutions in developing countries are still stuck on setting up data infrastructure in a way that allows them to leverage AI.\n\nHere are a few problems and AI solutions that many financial institutions are actively pursuing to create value. Of course, this is not a comprehensive list of all the AI initiatives the finance industry is experimenting with, but I would say these are some of the most popular trends.\n\nChatbots And Personalized Customer Service\n\nWith increasing automation, there is a fear of reduced loyalty due to less personal contact. However, increased AI usage does not necessarily mean less personalized experience, in fact, banks are using AI to increase client satisfaction, improve efficiency and maintain customer loyalty in many ways.\n\nBank of America has already developed a chatbot, Erica, an AI-enabled tool that provides financial guidance for the bank’s clients through voice and text messages. The service is accessible 24/7, and it can perform day-to-day transactions. This allows clients to have access to services at any time without costing more money hiring customer service personnel. Chatbots help ensure that, over time, less-typical queries have ready-made responses versus the current status quo where advisors often have to consult experts for immediate advice.\n\nTransactional and other data sources can be tracked to help understand a customer’s behavior and preferences to improve their experience. For instance, American multinational bank Wells Fargo created a new artificial intelligence enterprise solution team this year to better leverage data and customize their services.\n\nBanks understand the importance of accelerating and increasing connectivity with customers. Both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo recently launched their mobile banking apps -- Finn by Chase and Greenhouse by Wells Fargo. These apps were introduced with the aim of making customer interactions easier and attracting new clients, especially millennials. This sort of AI-based tech shows how banks are looking for new and creative ways to personalize the user experience and better understand customer behavior.\n\nWith AI’s potential to disrupt finance and fintech, the competition among leading institutions will rise in the following years. Large banks seem to have grasped the importance of innovation and the application of AI in their businesses, and they are starting to reap the benefits while the small and medium-sized institutions struggle to catch up.\n\nOne of the obstacles facing smaller companies in adopting AI is the shortage of talent. Bigger companies that have better reputations for innovation and higher profit-per-employee ratios are more likely to recruit top talent due to attractive paychecks for AI and machine learning experts. The good news, however, is that we are seeing AI startups that believe in equal access to AI technologies investing in educating and training more AI engineers with a goal of helping smaller and medium players.\n\nCompliance, Fraud Detection And Anti-Money-Laundering\n\nAvoiding fraud and money laundering is a challenge for many financial organizations. Artificial intelligence has the potential to help banks become more efficient in the process of detecting fraud and money laundering. To quickly identify potential fraud, AI engineers have developed tools and systems that automatically conduct and compress data that normally requires many hours of labor in just a matter of minutes, writes Alex Hickey of CIO Dive.\n\nLarger institutions are more inclined to update their legacy systems due to the rising number of fintech companies that are adopting AI. One of the banking giants, Citibank, is already using machine learning and big data to prevent criminal activities and monitor potential threats to customers in commerce. The company has adopted a new anti-money-laundering structure and has invested over $11 million to launch a new personal finance app that encourages customers to participate in third-party services.\n\nProcess Automation\n\nProcess automation with RPA is one of the key drivers of automation in financial institutions, but its also evolving into cognitive process automation, where AI systems are able to perform more complex automation. JPMorgan Chase recently invested in a new technology called COiN that reviews documents and extracts data in much less time than it would take a human. This tool reviews about 12,000 documents (which, without automation, would require more than 360,000 hours of work) in just seconds. The company has been testing other ways of using this technology.\n\nOur company has developed a similar product called the Intelligent Character Recognition System- ICR, which recognizes and extracts important information from loan applications, lease agreements, W-4 forms and receipts in order to save employees countless hours of work. These tools can drastically reduce the time spent reading or recording client information. Instead, time can be reallocated to performing revenue-generating tasks.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, these are just a few (but important) use cases of AI in banking, and there are many ways AI is being explored in the industry. Leaders, however, should ensure there is a clear plan and infrastructure in place to collect and merge data sets across the institution.

The court upheld the right of the state owned bank to close cryptocurrency exchange accounts without explanation. The judges determined that the bank’s actions were justified in terms of its compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and terrorist financing laws.\n\nThere was no evidence of money laundering through the exchange. The interpretation from the court appears to be that censorship-resistant, decentralized cryptocurrencies pose such a threat. From the Supreme Court ruling:\n\n“While there is no regulatory recognition of the activity [cryptocurrency], in order to comply with legal regulations from the entity mandated by law to monitor it, which seeks to prevent the bank and its products from being exploited in order to carry operations of money laundering or terrorist financing, among other possible risky activities.”\n\nThere is no legal recognition of cryptocurrencies in Chile and therefore, no regulatory framework. Notwithstanding that, use of cryptocurrency is not banned in the country. The ruling also claims that cryptocurrencies have “no intrinsic value” whilst not being backed by a government or a company.\n\nThe judges claim that it was impossible for the bank to comply with AML and terrorist financing regulations and laws relative to this case. “[cryptocurrency] prevents it [the bank] from knowing in depth financial activities related to cryptocurrencies developed by the appellant, the most relevant characteristics of its operations, the foundations on which these are supported and, finally, if their amounts are excessive or not”, reads the ruling.\n\nAs this ruling comes from Chile’s Supreme Court, it’s likely to have ramifications for the cryptocurrency industry in the country as their legal interpretation establishes a precedent view. Lower courts had upheld the complaint of OrionX – along with two other exchanges, Buda and CryptoMKT and ordered the reopening of accounts. However, as this is the highest court in the country, its ruling carries more weight than that of the courts that have examined the issue previously.\n\nIt would appear that it is a badge of convenience for the banks and the authorities to use the cover of AML and terrorist financing to suppress the development of decentralized cryptocurrency. It’s a scenario that has played out with the banks throughout the world to varying extents, including other South American countries.\n\nA similar drawn out scenario has occurred in Brazil where a number of retail banks closed the bank accounts of various cryptocurrency exchanges. A chain of legal clashes followed and whilst Banco do Brasil and Santander Brasil agreed to re-open accounts more recently, it remains to be seen if this is the end of the matter. Meanwhile, Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) have launched an investigation into alleged anti-competitive practice by the banks in relation to cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges have had to endure the same experience in Colombia. Davivenda, Bancolombia and BBVA spontaneously closed the accounts of crypto exchange Buda in June of this year. Buda has experienced the very same problems in Chile.\n\nGiven that this has now been determined at the highest court in the country, it may now take new legislation to prevent banks from discriminating against cryptocurrency exchanges. Many in the cryptocurrency space in the U.S. state of Wyoming suffered the same fate with the withdrawal of banking services without notice or explanation. However, despite the displeasure of the banks and much lobbying carried out by them, Wyoming is pushing through the Blockchain Bank bill.\n\nAmongst its progressive features is a part which deals with the issue of banking services for cryptocurrency exchanges and crypto related businesses.

According to Cleveland.com, Rep. Davidson announced that he will work to introduce his bill to the US House, at the Blockchain Solutions conference.\n\nThe new bill would create an, “asset class,” for cryptos, and, “would prevent them from being classified as securities, but would also allow the federal government to regulate initial coin offerings more effectively.”\n\nAs it stands today, the legislation for cryptos varies from state-to-state, and even within federal US Government regulatory bodies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classifies cryptos as securities, even though the Commodities and Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) classifies them as commodities.\n\nClearly, new legislation is needed in the world’s largest capital market.

While the case involving five agencies each extracting millions for SocGen’s violation of U.S. sanctions and money-laundering laws appears to be just the sort of piling on the department was pledging to avoid, others argue the DOJ’s policy is more nuanced and leaves room for interpretation, particularly over conduct.\n\nA view shows the logo on the headquarters of French bank Societe Generale at the financial and business district of La Defense near Paris, France, September 6, 2017.\n\nThe French banking giant last month agreed to pay U.S. federal and state authorities $1.34 billion to settle investigations into its handling dollar transactions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Cuba and other countries. The bank agreed to pay a further $95 million to settle another dispute over violations of anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2013, SocGen executed billions of dollars in illegal transactions to parties in countries subject to embargoes or otherwise sanctioned by the United States, including Iran, Sudan, Cuba and Libya, the authorities said.\n\nThe fines were issued by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York Department of Financial Services. The settlements represent the second largest penalty ever imposed on a financial institution for violations of U.S. economic sanctions.\n\nSocGen said when the settlements were announced that it acknowledged and regretted the shortcomings identified in the case, and that it had cooperated with U.S. authorities.\n\nIn a note to clients analyzing the agreement, lawyers at Davis Polk noted that DOJ earlier this year revised the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual to address the practice of “piling on” by multiple enforcement authorities in the context of corporate resolutions.\n\n“Among other things, the revised manual directs DOJ attorneys to consider ‘crediting and apportionment of financial penalties, fines, and forfeitures, and other means of avoiding disproportionate punishment’ and, when possible, ‘to coordinate with other federal, state, local, and foreign enforcement authorities’ in the assessment of penalties,” the law firm wrote.\n\n“It is notable, then, that each prosecutor and regulator involved in the settlements will receive payment from SocGen, with no crediting of payments made to other agencies and no suggestion by DOJ or any other agency that the penalty it imposed had been reduced in light of the penalties assessed by other agencies,” the firm added.\n\nDOJ POLICY HAS ‘CARVE OUTS’ THAT ALLOW FLEXIBILITY\n\nIn announcing the DOJ’s policy last May, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein outlined four key features to guide the agency in future cases:\n\n-First, the policy affirms that DOJ should not wield its criminal law enforcement authority for purposes unrelated to dealing with a potential crime, meaning that it should not “employ the threat of criminal prosecution solely to persuade a company to pay a larger settlement in a civil case.” Mr. Rosenstein noted that this was not a policy change, but a reminder of DOJ’s commitment to fairness.\n\n-Second, the policy directs DOJ components to “coordinate with one another [to] achieve an overall equitable result,” including “crediting and apportionment of financial penalties, fines, and forfeitures, and other means of avoiding disproportionate punishment.”\n\n-Third, the policy encourages DOJ attorneys “when possible, to coordinate with other federal, state, local, and foreign enforcement authorities seeking to resolve a case with a company” based on the same conduct giving rise to civil or criminal liability.\n\n-Fourth, the policy puts forth a list of factors that DOJ attorneys may use to evaluate whether multiple penalties against a company will “serve the interests of justice in a particular case.” These factors include: (1) “the egregiousness of the wrongdoing”; (2) “statutory mandates regarding penalties”; (3) “the risk of delay in finalizing a resolution”; and (4) “the adequacy and timeliness of a company’s disclosures and cooperation with the department.”\n\nAccording to some legal experts, the last category — specifically the conduct exhibited by SocGen in the course of its violations — may have been a determining factor to allow multiple agencies to penalize the French lender.\n\n“The policy itself has carve outs, if you will, to reach a just outcome,” said Pablo Quiñones, founder of Quiñones Law PLLC and former federal prosecutor and strategy and policy chief at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n“It could be that due to the nature of the conduct, the DoJ may have felt that the equitable result would be to permit (SocGen) to pay certain additional amounts to obtain a coordinated overall resolution,” said Quiñones.\n\nIt appears that conduct was indeed a factor in the SocGen settlement. In response to a request for comment on the settlement and the DOJ’s policy on “piling on,” DOJ spokesman Mark Pettit told Regulatory Intelligence in a written statement:\n\n“In reaching the criminal resolution, the Department of Justice was careful to adhere to the policy recently announced by the Deputy Attorney General. The policy requires coordination with other federal and state enforcement authorities and consideration of the amount of penalties paid by the company to those authorities in order to avoid unnecessary or duplicative penalties. This policy is intended to ensure that the department only pursues sanctions that are proportionate to the defendants’ conduct and the legitimate goals of law enforcement.”\n\nAs Davis Polk notes in its own analysis, SocGen’s conduct “perhaps bears less resemblance to the conduct at issue in more recent U.S. economic sanctions enforcement actions against financial institutions. . .and instead is more evocative of earlier settlements,” the firm said.\n\n“In particular, SocGen’s concealment activities and the non-transparent use of payment messages are reminiscent of the conduct at issue in the DOJ’s 2014 settlement with a different non-U.S. financial institution, still by far the largest of its kind,” the firm added, referring to BNP Paribas’s guilty plea and fine of $8.9 billion for U.S. sanctions violations.\n\nThe lesson from the SocGen case, say experts, is that egregious conduct may well supersede any policy initiatives that seek to avoid the appearance of “piling on,” and that firms need to factor this into their internal deliberations and engagement with U.S. agencies when faced with violations.\n\n(Henry Engler, Regulatory Intelligence, New York)',187,0.99,'The bank agreed to pay a further $95 million to settle another dispute over violations of anti-money laundering regulations.\nThe settlements represent the second largest penalty ever imposed on a financial institution for violations of U.S. economic sanctions.\nIn a note to clients analyzing the agreement, lawyers at Davis Polk noted that DOJ earlier this year revised the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual to address the practice of “piling on” by multiple enforcement authorities in the context of corporate resolutions.\nIt appears that conduct was indeed a factor in the SocGen settlement.\nThe policy requires coordination with other federal and state enforcement authorities and consideration of the amount of penalties paid by the company to those authorities in order to avoid unnecessary or duplicative penalties.',1058,512,0),('Advertisement\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has updated its guide for businesses that want to raise capital via initial coin offerings (ICOs).\n\nThe modified draft follows up to the announcement of introducing a “New Payments Framework” made in the original draft. It elaborates the Singapore central bank’s stance on how certain intermediaries should observe its instructions based on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) policies.\n\nThese intermediaries include almost every participant that is involved in the activities related to an ICO asset. From those that produce the tokens to those that facilitate their trading on their online platforms to those that provide financial consultation regarding these tokens — everybody is subjected to the law. For instance, an ICO issuer must obtain capital markets services license, financial advisers must get a financial advisory license (from the FAA), and a digital asset exchange must be approved and acknowledged by the MAS.\n\nThe New Payments Framework clarifies that all such intermediaries are liable to “take appropriate steps to identify, assess, and understand their money laundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) risks.” The guidelines order them to develop and implement internal policies under appropriate MAS notices that would allow the central bank to monitor customers’ due diligence and transactions, alongside financial records, per the law.\n\nMAS guidelines say that even if a token is not a security, it still needs to determine its compliance with the AML/CFT acts. It means that they are liable to report suspicious activities and are legally responsible if they are found to be working with people or groups branded as terrorists by Singaporean intelligence agencies and the United Nations.\n\nThe MAS in November introduced a new Payment Services Bill (PSB) in the Singaporean Parliament, bringing digital currency under the laws mentioned for domestic and international money transfers and foreign exchange transactions. The updated securities guidelines also include the PSB as an enabler of AML/CFT acts inside the ICO space. Excerpt:\n\n“A person carrying on a business of providing any service of dealing in digital payment tokens or any service of facilitating the exchange of digital payment tokens must be licensed and will be regulated under the PSB for AML/CFT purposes only and will be required to put in place policies, procedures and controls to address its AML/TF risks.”\n\nThe rest of the draft, meanwhile, resembles what was issued in November 2017, most notably the eleven kinds of digital tokens and their different obligations.\n\nThe updated copy of the new ICO guidelines can be accessed here.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock\n\nAdvertisement\n\n',191,0.68,'AdvertisementThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has updated its guide for businesses that want to raise capital via initial coin offerings (ICOs).\nThese intermediaries include almost every participant that is involved in the activities related to an ICO asset.\nMAS guidelines say that even if a token is not a security, it still needs to determine its compliance with the AML/CFT acts.\nThe updated securities guidelines also include the PSB as an enabler of AML/CFT acts inside the ICO space.\nThe updated copy of the new ICO guidelines can be accessed here.',424,513,0),('Some 40 bond creditors of Energy Earth Plc submit a letter to Pol Maj Gen Preecha at the Amlo office, seeking progress into examining money and asset transfers of the companys executives.

His pay - about 55,000 euros annually plus expenses - was almost as high as that of the prime minister.\n\nSimon Busuttil, a former leader of the opposition Nationalist Party in Malta, told Reuters that Tonna’s work as a personal accountant for government figures and his government contracts created a conflict of interest. “The bar for ethical standards has now been lowered so far by this government, it has been crushed into the ground,” he said.\n\nTonna declined to comment. A spokesman for Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, said the prime minister was not involved in granting Tonna’s government contract.\n\nTonna was hired as an adviser to Owen Bonnici, minister for justice. The work was in addition to previously disclosed business contracts, worth more than 800,000 euros, awarded by other government ministries to NexiaBT, an accountancy firm that Tonna owns.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesman for Bonnici said that Tonna and NexiaBT “offered advice and technical guidance on purely financial matters relating to infrastructural projects in the field of culture.” Asked if Tonna’s employment involved any conflicts of interest and how this was managed, the spokesman did not respond.\n\nTonna set up companies in Panama that in 2015 he transferred to Keith Schembri, the prime minister’s chief of staff, and Konrad Mizzi, then energy minister and now tourism minister. Tonna has known Schembri as a personal friend and client for 20 years, according to a written declaration made by Tonna and seen by Reuters. Mizzi engaged NexiaBT as a personal accountant in 2015, according to his own statements. Schembri and Mizzi did not respond to questions about the contracts given to Tonna.\n\nTonna’s role in creating companies for Schembri and Mizzi was first disclosed by Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist who was murdered in October 2017. No evidence has emerged that connects her death to any of her journalism. Details of Tonna’s personal government consultancy contract emerged from Freedom of Information requests for details of any payments made to either Tonna or Nexia BT since the current administration took power in 2013. The requests were filed by the Times of Malta and the results shared with Reuters.\n\nThey showed that his full-time contract was worth 54,684 euros annually, plus 7,474 euros in allowances for his expenses, including for his car and mobile phone. The part-time contract was worth 38,241 euros plus 3,736 euros in expenses. The prime minister earns 55,978 euros plus 6,769 euros in allowances, his spokesman told Reuters.\n\nIn May 2017, Maltese authorities launched a judicial investigation into payments totalling 100,000 euros made by Tonna to Schembri at a private bank. As Reuters reported in April here, the probe was launched after Maltas anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit (FIAU), said in a report that the payments gave rise to \"reasonable suspicion of money laundering.\" Both men have denied any wrongdoing and said the 100,000 euros were repayment of a personal loan. The FIAU declined to comment on the investigation, which continues.\n\nIn November, Prime Minister Muscat came under political pressure from opposition lawmakers to sack or suspend Mizzi and Schembri after Reuters reported new details here about 17 Black, an obscure company based in Dubai. That company, according to an email from NexiaBT, planned to pay up to 2 million euros to Panama companies owned by Mizzi and Schembri.\n\nAccording to government statements following the Reuters report, 17 Blacks activities are now the subject of both a criminal probe by police and a judicial investigation. Muscat told reporters here in Malta that if he were implicated in any wrongdoing by the probes, he would resign.\n\nTonna said he was “fully committed to cooperating with the authorities.”',194,0.95,'His pay - about 55,000 euros annually plus expenses - was almost as high as that of the prime minister.\nA spokesman for Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, said the prime minister was not involved in granting Tonna’s government contract.\nThe prime minister earns 55,978 euros plus 6,769 euros in allowances, his spokesman told Reuters.\nIn May 2017, Maltese authorities launched a judicial investigation into payments totalling 100,000 euros made by Tonna to Schembri at a private bank.\nMuscat told reporters here in Malta that if he were implicated in any wrongdoing by the probes, he would resign.',725,516,0),('FOR nearly five years now, the unfolding 1 Malaysian Development Bhd or 1MDB scandal has had little or no impact on Wall Street even though US investment banking giant Goldman Sachs was at the core of the shenanigans and a key enabler.\n\nNew York’s financial circles hardly noticed when 1MDB helped bring down the government of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak in May. Indeed, even the US Department of Justice (DoJ) indictments of Penang-born wheeler-dealer Low Taek Jho or Jho Low, Goldman Sachs ex-partner Tim Leissner and his deputy Roger Ng last month barely made a ripple in the financial markets.\n\nYet, last week, 1MDB was washing up on Wall Street like a tsunami. By the time the selling was done, Goldman Sachs stock was down a whopping 17%. The shares are now down over 30% from their late January peak, making Goldman by far the worst-performing large US financial stock this year.\n\nWhen large stocks plummet, not just analysts, investors and financial media but also board members, top management and regulators are forced to sit up and take notice. The market is saying something is rotten at Goldman Sachs and swift action is needed. When the dust around the 1MDB scandal settles, Goldman and indeed the old ways of doing business in Wall Street could change.\n\nHere’s why Goldman is in trouble: It raised US$6.5 billion for 1MDB. The US Department of Justice alleges that over US$3.5 billion was misappropriated from those funds by Jho Low, a close confidant of Najib. In pleading guilty to money laundering and bribery charges, Leissner blamed the 1MDB shenanigans on Goldman’s “culture” to work around internal legal and compliance controls as it was highly focused on consummating deals. Jho Low has been charged in absentia with money laundering and violation of bribery laws by the DoJ. He remains on the run reportedly in hiding in China. Another former Goldman executive, Roger Ng, who was arrested by Malaysian authorities last month and is currently awaiting extradition to the US, has yet to enter a plea. Malaysia wants back the US$600 million 1MDB paid in fees to Goldma and restitution of a big chunk of the US$3.5 billion it lost.\n\nOn Nov 22, Abu Dhabi ’s state-owned International Petroleum Investment Company, and its subsidiary, Aabar, sued Goldman for its “central role” in the scandal.\n\nTo be sure, the rapidly unfolding 1MDB scandal is the most serious existential crisis that venerable Goldman (founded in 1869) has faced since the heady days of late 2008 when, at the height of the global financial crisis as the world’s largest investment bank, it reached out for help to the US Federal Reserve as well as billionaire investor Warren Buffett for additional liquidity and capital to keep itself afloat.\n\nUntil recently, the sceptical narrative around Goldman and 1MDB was that irrespective of its 1MDB problems, the Wall Street behemoth would cut a deal with the DoJ, pay a billion or so in fines and turn over a new leaf just as it has after every scandal in its history, including the global financial crisis.\n\nNow, increasingly, there are concerns in Wall Street of far-reaching regulatory sanctions, above and beyond the fines, both in the US as well in Asia. There is also the long-term reputational damage to Goldman in Asia, the Middle East and emerging markets. Its franchise is already feeling strains in Southeast Asia since the 1MDB scandal first broke five years ago. And in Northeast Asia, Chinese banks as well as US rivals Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Citigroup have clawed back market share at its expense.\n\nLet’s look at just how much might Goldman may have to pay in fines, refund of overcharged fees and restitution to Malaysia.\n\nThere is a wide range of outcomes on what the fines and penalties could be, notes Betsy Graseck, bank analyst for Morgan Stanley.\n\nAlthough she has pencilled only US$1.8 billion in financial hit for Goldman at a minimum, Graseck notes that the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s anti-bribery provisions permit fines of up to twice the amount of fees obtained, in addition to returning the fees.\n\nChristian Bolu, analyst for Sanford C Bernstein in New York, estimates that Goldman will have to disgorge its US$600 million fees from the 1MDB bonds, plus a minimum of US$600 million in fines under Anti-Money Laundering laws, US$100 million in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) fines and at least US$810 million in restitution to the Malaysian government for losses on 1MDB.\n\nThat’s US$2.11 billion in total.\n\nBolu says he based his estimates on recent enforcement actions around AML and FCPA. In 2012, HSBC paid US$1.26 billion in fines after it settled its anti-money laundering case with the DoJ. Earlier this year, US Bancorp paid US$613 million in settlement of its own anti-money laundering case.\n\nJust two months ago, Brazil’s Petrobras settled its Foreign Corrupt Practices case by paying US$853 million in fines. Bernstein’s US bank analyst notes that in its latest regulatory 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Goldman increased “provisions” for “reasonable possible losses from US$1.5 billion in the June quarter to US$1.8 billion in the last quarter. Most of those provisions are for 1MDB-related fines.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts see a parallel between Goldman’s involvement in the 1MDB scandal and the Salomon Brothers’ Treasury bid-rigging scandal in 1991 that cost its high-­flying CEO John Gutfreund his job and eventually led to the demise of the brokerage and bond trading giant.\n\nSalomon was rescued by Warren Buffett nearly 27 years ago, not as a passive investor — the way he helped saved Goldman 17 years later — but as an active interim chairman of the board who helped guide the venerable investment house to safety before exiting at a nice profit. (Salomon was bought by insurer Travelers Group which merged with Citigroup in the late 1990s. Citi, in turn, sold the brokerage and wealth management unit to Morgan Stanley in the aftermath of the 2009 financial crisis.)\n\nLike Goldman’s dismissal of 1MDB, Salomon’s bid-rigging scandal, which was initially rejected by its top managers and the board as something just confined to a rogue bond trader, eventually spread all the way to the top, ultimately becoming a criminal investigation, encircling the powerful helmsman Gutfreund after it became clear that he had been repeatedly alerted about bond auctions scam but had refused to act until after the scandal became public. That’s exactly is what is happening at Goldman.\n\nEssentially, the 1MDB scandal has moved from wrongdoings by upper mid-tier executives — Leissner, Vella and Ng— to what looks like potentially a criminal “cover-up” stage where the key is not just when Goldman’s top honchos first got a whiff of the foul 1MDB’s stench, or exactly what they knew, but whether they deliberately tried to hide material information about the 1MDB scandal and their own involvement in it from the board, investors and other stakeholders and, indeed, have been lying about the ongoing cover-up for months, if not years.\n\nIt is now clear from Leissner’s testimony that Goldman’s then CEO and current chairman Lloyd Blankfein was reportedly at two separate meetings with Jho Low and Leissner himself, the first one as far back in 2009, which was also attended by Najib, apart from one-on-one meeting with Jho Low and another meeting with Low and Aabar’s CEO Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Husseiny.\n\nAs recently as a few months ago, Blankfein was feigning ignorance. Initially, he didn’t recall meeting Low. Then he admitted meeting Jho Low but only because the chubby Penang-born fugitive had accompanied Najib and Leissner to their meetings. Now, it turns out that Jho Low accompanied Al-Husseiny and indeed even had a one-on-one meeting with the then Goldman boss. For months, Cohn and Salomon have also distanced themselves from Low and Najib as well as knowledge of any malfeasance and bribery. Now, it turns out that they knew a lot more than they have been letting on for some time.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Goldman cutting a deal with DoJ and agreeing to pay a few billions in fines will allow its top brass to walk away unscathed. Going by the Salomon Brothers and Gutfreund case, heads will have to roll. Six months ago, just after the Malaysian elections that ousted Najib’s government, and before Blankfein stepped down as CEO in September, Goldman probably still had an option of coming clean, admitting to malfeasance and negligence, paying hefty fines and returning US$600 million that it charged in fees to Malaysia, and moving on. That easy option may have lapsed. Now, there is the matter of six additional months of cover-up, which involves not only Blankfein but also the current CEO David Salomon who took over the reins on Oct 1 and has been as vociferous in his denials as his predecessor.\n\nSo, not only has the 1MDB cover-up been going on for a while now, it involved not just one or two but almost the entire top brass of Goldman at one point or another. And it was the prolonged cover-up of the bond scandal, by one of its “Big Swinging Dick” traders, which brought down Salomon Brothers and not the scandal itself.\n\nFines are not the only hit Goldman will take. Bernstein’s Bolu argues that reputational damage inflicted by the 1MDB debacle could drive Goldman’s new management team to tighten its new business approval process, especially in higher-risk emerging market regions. In 2010, when the US SEC fined Goldman US$550 million for pre-crisis mortgage CDO related issues to address the reputational fallout, the firm formed a Business Standard Committee that issued recommendations, including tighter transaction approval process in the trading businesses. He notes that constrained risk appetite is partly to blame for market share declines in its fixed income, currencies and commodities business over the last five years.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Graseck says her main concern is the potential fallout of the 1MDB investigation, how long it will take to resolve the issue, what the fines and penalties could be and what costs will Goldman incur to satisfy regulators. Goldman could also face a temporary ban in Asia. Earlier this year, Hong Kong regulators banned UBS from sponsoring initial public offerings for 18 months after an investigation into the Swiss bank’s role in certain listings on its stock exchange.\n\nWhether Goldman takes over US$2 billion hit — about US$1.5 billion in fines and a US$600 million payout to Malaysian government — the base case being cited by Wall Street analysts — or needs to fork out US$3.5 billion — up to US$2 billion payout to Malaysia and another US$1.5 billion or so in fines plus sanctions, including temporary suspension of its investment banking licence in Asia ex-China and Japan — is a moot point.\n\nWhat is clear, however, is that the iconic investment bank’s franchise is likely to take a huge hit aside from the huge fines and it will probably take years, even decades, to shake off its “vampire squid” reputation.\n\nAssif Shameen is contributing editor at The Edge',196,0.00,'When the dust around the 1MDB scandal settles, Goldman and indeed the old ways of doing business in Wall Street could change.\nJho Low has been charged in absentia with money laundering and violation of bribery laws by the DoJ.\nIts franchise is already feeling strains in Southeast Asia since the 1MDB scandal first broke five years ago.\nThen he admitted meeting Jho Low but only because the chubby Penang-born fugitive had accompanied Najib and Leissner to their meetings.\nNow, it turns out that Jho Low accompanied Al-Husseiny and indeed even had a one-on-one meeting with the then Goldman boss.',1838,517,0),('On 5th December 2018, Christian Elongue attended a workshop organised by Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII) to enhance knowledge and awareness on the Africa Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption (AUCPCC).

Regarding civil society and media, it has been recommended that:\n\nMore and better civil society advocacy is needed to enhance effective engagement of stakeholders and government on the implementation of the AUCPCC.\n\nCSOs should prepare their own reports on monitoring activities of the Board for the consideration of the AU Commission\n\nCSOs should hold government accountable and responsible for ensuring the implementation of the AUCPCC and also request for feedback on the reporting obligations as well as challenges Government may be encountering;\n\nCSOs need to lobby for representation on the Board and collaborate more closely with relevant key state institutions on the AU Convention.\n\nAt the end of the program, CSO and media practitioners have commended the current government for implementing measures and strategies, including the creation of the Office of the Special Prosecutor to support the fight against corruption. But the reality is that corruption remain consistent and persists despites these efforts.\n\nWe strongly believe that the Government should move from slogans to actions. It therefore requires a stronger leadership, oversight institutions and financial support to help strengthen existing anti-corruption systems and support civil society in eradicating corruption. We also need to reorient our attitudes and perceptions as citizens and not spectators. Fighting corruption is a collective responsibility and everyone must contribute with his own quota. We need to eschew politicisation of corruption and encourage citizens to reject and run-away from this canker wherever they are.',197,1.00,'Funding of Political Parties : The Ghana Political Parties Act 2000 (Act 574), do not cater for the activities of political party candidates in Parliamentary elections.\n: The Ghana Political Parties Act 2000 (Act 574), do not cater for the activities of political party candidates in Parliamentary elections.\nFor instance, a short pre-training evaluation revealed that many CSO and media practitioners were more aware of the United Nation Convention Against Corruption than the African Union Convention on Corruption.\nFor instance, a short pre-training evaluation revealed that many CSO and media practitioners were more aware of the United Nation Convention Against Corruption than the African Union Convention on Corruption.\nDespite the recent advocacy actions from civil society it is still difficult to predict when it shall be enacted.',1050,518,0),('Students around Ireland are being tricked by cybercriminals into becoming unwitting money launderers, gardaí say.\n\nGangs specialising in online fraud are approaching people on Irish campuses and asking them to allow money to be transferred through their accounts.

LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nCommercial bank Signature Bank is launching a new payments platform for institutional clients powered by a permissioned version of the ethereum blockchain.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with trueDigital Holdings in New York, the Signet Platform lets Signature Bank clients move money in 30 seconds, 24-hours a day, seven days a week by converting U.S. dollars into tokens compliant with ethereum’s ERC-20 standard.\n\nTraditional corporate payments using the Swift interbank platform or the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network can take as long as three days and are generally unavailable during the weekend, frequently resulting in lost business when opportunities require more swift reactions.\n\nWhile this early implementation of blockchain is limited in that only Signature customers can use the always-on service, it is also part of a larger plan that could eventually see the bank directly connecting to others without the need of an intermediary.\n\nSignature Bank cofounder and CEO sees the adoption of the private version of ethereum as a case of disrupt or be disrupted.\n\n“We have to do this, otherwise we’re not going to exist,” said DePaolo. “If you’re not involved in blockchain, in five years, you won’t be around as a bank.”\n\nOriginally popularized for powering the bitcoin cryptocurrency without the need of banks, blockchains and other distributed ledgers are now being pursued as a way to simplify a number of middle- and back-office workflows in banking and other industries.\n\nUnlike other ethereum tokens that comply with ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, Signature Bank’s digitized dollars, or signets, are designed to only work on the banks proprietary Signet Platform, and are not expected to interoperate with other exchanges and services built to accommodate the standard.\n\nHowever, a statement provided to Forbes by trueDigitital indicated this is just the first step to adding other currencies and pairs. “This will significantly reduce costs, counterparty risk and settlement times,\" said trueDigital founder and CEO Sunil Hirani in a statement.\n\nThe Signet Platform will open to commercial clients of Signature Bank on January 1, 2019 at 12:01 a.m. ET. At the time of launch the transactions will be free, but they also require a minimum balance of $250,000.\n\nDeposits held within the Signet Platform are eligible for FDIC insurance, up to the legal insurable amounts defined by the FDIC. Because the platform is restricted to Signature Bank clients, all users must pass the bank’s anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer compliance.\n\nLaunched in May 2001, Signature Bank generated $155.4 million net income for the 2018 third quarter and now manages $45 billion in assets.\n\nAlso announced today, the Signet Platform has been approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, making it the first bank to receive regulatory permission to use blockchain in this capacity.\n\n“New York continues to support and help advance innovation through sound state regulation,” said Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo, in a statement. “And with products such as Signet, which provide lower-cost ways for businesses to efficiently make payments.”\n\nWhile the service is free at the time of launch, DePaolo said he wasn’t sharing plans for how they might monetize the service in the future.\n\nThe launch of Signet isn’t the first time the founder of little-known trueDigital Holdings made headlines. Prior to partnering with Signature Bank, trueDigital founder Sunil Hirani founded Digital Asset Holdings, which has raised $107 million venture capital, and is best known for winning the contract to help the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) replatform its CHESS electronic-book-entry register for securities.\n\n“The launch of Signet will address an obvious need that diverse ecosystems have for exchanging funds repeatedly with the same counterparty,” said Hirani, who faces tough competition in the space. Earlier this year Hirani filed a lawsuit that alleges 11 banks conspired to boycott his trueEX interest rate swaps platform.\n\nIn fact, Swift itself has also been exploring blockchain, though it deemed the technology not ready for the high volumes their workload requires. Other competition is also coming from Ripple, a venture-backed startup using its own proprietary distributed ledger similar to a permissioned version of ethereum.\n\nWhile Ripple is designed to leverage the XRP cryptocurrency as a way to increase liquidity, DePaolo isn’t interested in directly leveraging crypto any time soon. As is, the Signet platform is capable of handling “thousands of transactions per second,” according to a company representative, but can be scaled to accommodate “tens of thousands of transactions per second.”\n\nGoing forward, DePaolo believes that other banks will likely offer similar intra-bank payments solutions that streamline back- and middle-office workflows, and eventually connect directly to each other.\n\n“I believe that consolidation of financial institutions will be swift,” said DePaolo. “I think that consolidation will occur because there will be a number of banks that say, we can’t do this, we don’t want to invest in it.”',201,1.00,'LightRocket via Getty ImagesCommercial bank Signature Bank is launching a new payments platform for institutional clients powered by a permissioned version of the ethereum blockchain.\nSignature Bank cofounder and CEO sees the adoption of the private version of ethereum as a case of disrupt or be disrupted.\nThe Signet Platform will open to commercial clients of Signature Bank on January 1, 2019 at 12:01 a.m.\nDeposits held within the Signet Platform are eligible for FDIC insurance, up to the legal insurable amounts defined by the FDIC.\nLaunched in May 2001, Signature Bank generated $155.4 million net income for the 2018 third quarter and now manages $45 billion in assets.',806,522,0),('Cayman’s leaders spent most of Thursday (6 December) planning and prepping for constitutional talks with the UK government.\n\nCayman’s delegation is being led by Premier Hon.

The EU initiative threatens non-compliant jurisdictions with a blacklisting and punitive measures.\n\nMr. Stride said the U.K. had worked to ensure that the process was fair by calling for the use of objective criteria in the EU assessment.

All British territories and Crown dependencies are expected to meet economic substance requirements of the EU and the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices.\n\nThe U.K., meanwhile, confirmed its plans to make public registers of beneficial ownership a global standard by 2023. The U.K. Parliament passed the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act in May. The act includes a controversial clause threatening the issuance of an order in council that would impose public registers showing the true owners of companies and other entities in the overseas territories, if they have not been introduced by the end of 2020.\n\nThe U.K.’s expectation is that such registers would be fully implemented and operational by 2023 and that the order could be drafted accordingly.\n\nThis type of interference in devolved policy areas has previously been criticized as “colonial,” as it effectively disenfranchises elected officials and their electorate in the territories. As a result, the constitutional relationship between the U.K. and its territories has been put under strain.\n\nSeveral territories have subsequently started talks with the U.K. to revise certain aspects of their constitutional arrangements.\n\nChloe Smith, parliamentary secretary and minister for the Constitution, said the U.K. wants to have positive constitutional relationships with the territories, but admitted the passage of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act had caused some challenges.\n\nThe aim, she said, was to recognize that the overseas territories are self-governing and subject only to the U.K. retaining power to carry out its obligations under international law.\n\nDisaster preparedness\n\nIn the morning session, overseas territories leaders presented updates of their disaster preparedness on Wednesday, with territories impacted by hurricanes last year highlighting the recovery progress they have made.\n\nLord Tariq Ahmad, minister in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said the U.K. appreciated the effort by Cayman and others in providing assistance to the territories impacted by the tropical cyclones.\n\nThe U.K. continues to coordinate disaster management planning across the overseas territories for hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, serious flooding and volcanic activity.

This includes working with the Governor’s Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to pilot the FCO’s Crisis Hub, which is a tool to aid in evacuations and in tracking missing persons during disasters.\n\nThe Cayman Islands has also agreed to participate in a formal regional Overseas Territory Rapid Deployment Team that can swiftly provide support for impacted territories.

Massively hyped concert-like product announcements, hip conferences replete with famous musical headliners, open offices, beer on draft, and so-called unicorn companies have all been the domain of the tech industry.\n\nWant to learn more about financial technology? Discover the best financial services software in 2019.\n\nWhile some of those things will remain exclusive to that world, there is no doubt that the financial services industry has become flush with a vitality that has accompanied significant technological change. That change has become apparent during the past few years, particularly with the injection of blockchain into the mainstream consciousness.\n\nWhile Bitcoin and the rest of its cryptocurrency cohorts have dominated the headlines and inspired millions of words in digital and physical ink, there are a host of fintech applications and industry subsections that have remained outside the spotlight. Those applications will see increased adoption over the next few years and solidify the notion that fintech is here to stay.\n\nFintech is transforming the financial services industry, and will continue to do so as the industry makes the shift to fostering innovation. Fintech products improve the ease with which people can make cross border remittances, increase the number of data points used to make loan decisions, automate regulatory functions, and more.\n\nThe breadth of fintech project types has expanded greatly over the past few years, with innovation in multiple fintech subcategories driving adoption in sectors such as insurance and regulation. Insurance technology, a branch of fintech, has seen machine learning applications automate internal processes and claim processing.\n\n1. Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation\n\nAn increase in connected devices and the means to process that data is driving the creation of personalized insurance products based on an individual’s data sets. Regulatory technology has seen know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering software infused with artificial intelligence pop up in the past couple of years.\n\nThese solutions, along with those dealing with compliance, risk management, transaction monitoring, and regulatory reporting, will continue to develop as more and more is sunk into their creation and adoption. Fintech investment, innovation, and adoption will continue to grow rapidly in the next few years as companies start to see significant return on investment (ROI) from fintech investments.\n\nPrediction: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software will be widely used in 75% of financial services institutions by the end of 2019.\n\nRPA refers to robotic process automation software programs that automate repetitive human processes by utilizing the exact same application interface a human would, eliminating built-in human inefficiencies. For example, a robot might carry out a data entry task utilizing Microsoft Excel and the company CRM software.\n\nThe robot would use the exact same applications to get the task done, but would finish much more quickly, its speed being limited only by the speed of the various applications it would use. The financial services industry in particular contains a large amount of roles built around data entry and repetitive tasks. Robots, provided they are trained properly, can take care of these tasks for any department.\n\nRobots cost around $15K annually per unit, with an initial implementation cost of $40K–$50K per robot. That’s a lot of money in start-up costs, but companies typically see 40–100% ROI within 3–8 months. The annual cost of running a robot to help with automation is nothing compared the cost of paying someone to do the same tasks much less efficiently. RPA can and will help financial services institutions increase efficiency and eliminate wasted time, particularly when it comes to tedious, easily repeatable tasks.\n\nAs of the end of 2017, 11% of financial services institutions viewed themselves as having adopted RPA widely across their organization. The improvements seen in robots as well as an improvement in the knowledge about RPA and its potential use cases will drive an upswing in adoption and deployment in 2019, and continue over the next few years.\n\n1. Mobile Payments Grow Globally\n\nPrediction: The worldwide volume of mobile payments will grow by 60% over the next two years. Mobile payments’ growth will exceed 75% in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa during the same period\n\nThe worldwide mobile banking and payments industry is massive, processing over a billion dollars per day in 2017. Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa in particular have seen widespread adoption of mobile payments because of financial exclusion. Financial exclusion refers to situations in which financial services (banking, payments, etc.) are not available. This often occurs in more economically disadvantaged areas, or areas that traditional financial services institutions have deemed not worth the investment.\n\nBarriers to entry put up by traditional brick-and-mortar banks have catalyzed the development and widespread use of mobile banking as both a primary and exclusive method of financial management. The proof of identification and funds that traditional bank applications require bar some from qualifying for an account, while distance to a brick-and-mortar location (experienced by those in rural areas) is a barrier for others. Mobile payments allow them to gain some degree of financial inclusion without meeting the standards typically set by traditional financial institutions.\n\nMobile banking can be far more accessible than traditional banks, and smartphone adoption is driving that accessibility. Anyone with a smartphone and internet access can become a part of the financial system without the need to open a traditional bank account.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, one of the regions with the most potential for mobile money use, 21% of residents currently had a mobile money account in 2017, double the number that did in 2014. If the past is any indication, the mobile money market will continue to grow at an astonishing rate in the region, as well as in other regions with low financial inclusion but relatively widespread internet access and smartphone use.\n\nMobile banking will continue to grow rapidly, particularly in areas currently reliant on the technology. In addition, blockchain will tie itself into the industry and become an integral part of fintech within the mobile banking industry. Blockchain technology will provide an immutable record of personal data for individuals looking to use mobile payment solutions, giving the industry an added layer of security. The security inherent in these blockchain solutions will prevent fraud and improve the ability for people to become part of the financial system.\n\nAnother development that will support mobile payments adoption is the development and deployment of 5G technology. For mobile banking to become ubiquitous, the development of 5G technology is paramount. 5G tech reduces latency and transaction times, which is key to ensuring the network can handle the amount of transactions at scale.\n\n2. Payment Services Directive 2.0 (PSD2) and Fintech App Development\n\nPrediction: Seventy-five percent of large banks will be actively engaged in supporting fintech application development through open banking. This will be driven by Payment Services Directive 2.0 (PSD2)\n\nPSD2 is a European Union regulatory directive designed to increase competition within the European payments industry, solicit participation in the industry from non-banks, and protect payment solution users. While PSD2 is a European directive, the concept of open banking has spread internationally and will drive financial product development. Enhancing consumer protection and a desire to create legitimate competition is healthy for the banking industry, and will drive innovation in the financial services sector, specifically in the banking sector.\n\nOpen banking, while perhaps far from being codified and mandated in the U.S., is here to stay. Open banking refers to banks being forced to release their data sets in a secure and standardized manner. This data can include everything from bank locations to customer transaction records. The ultimate goal is to allow third parties (or the tech division within a bank) to utilize that data to create products.\n\nTo stay ahead of the curve and reap some of the benefits of that innovation, banks will actively engage in supporting fintech application development by giving more access to their data than explicitly stated in PSD2 or any other directive that comes from the regulatory bodies. By actively promoting open banking innovation and forging fintech partnerships with companies using their data sets, banks will be able to enhance their existing products and leverage innovative fintech products being created with their data. In this way, banks can exert some degree of control over how their data is being used and ideally (for them, if not for the market) get something out of it.\n\n3. Fintech Companies Become the Norm\n\nPrediction: Fintech companies will shift from disruptors to partners in the financial services industry\n\nThis will be prompted by the regulatory difficulties experienced by both fintech and traditional financial institutions and the need for high-level buy-in to get widespread adoption. Fintech has, until now, been viewed by the financial services industry as a potential disruptor. This is due in part to the shadow of revolution that blockchain and the cryptocurrency hype cast over the entire industry.\n\nFair or not, fintech and cryptocurrency were entwined in the public eye. Now, however, particularly in the financial services industry, there is a greater degree of understanding of the technology.\n\nThe industry saw fintech as potentially operating outside the realm of regulation, which is the initial intention of cryptocurrencies. However, crypto is a small subset of the potential uses housed under the fintech umbrella. Additional applications labeled as fintech include regulatory technology (regtech), insurance technology (insurtech), and smart contracts. Fintech companies will still disrupt the industry, but not revolutionize it as previously thought because of the wall of regulation they have run into.\n\nWhile powerful regulatory bodies have yet to pass specific directives regarding the rules that govern fintech, they have engaged in multiple enforcement actions against fintech companies. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently created and released the Fintech Charter.\n\nIn it, the agency lays down relatively ambiguous guidelines for fintech companies that indicate their desire to shackle them to existing financial services regulations. Instead of revolutionizing, fintech companies will contribute to the evolution of the financial services industry. To have the desired degree of impact, particularly in the banking industry, fintech companies will partner with traditional financial services institutions.\n\nThe institutions themselves will likely be the drivers of these partnerships, as they have more to gain from leveraging new technology and the resources to sink into promising projects without risking many resources. One prime example of a successful partnership is that of CurrencyCloud and Monese, a mobile-only UK based bank.\n\nMonese needed the ability to have customers make international transactions, but there was a ton of regulatory hurdles that needed to be cleared for that to happen. They ended up partnering with CurrencyCloud, a fintech that gave them access to their API, allowed them to bypass those hurdles, reduce forex costs, and reduce payment costs as well. These partnerships, while currently more popular for community banks, will be seen at a larger scale in 2019 and over the next few years.\n\n4. Smart Contracts and the Real-Estate Industry\n\nPrediction: Smart contracts will catalyze the evolution and improve the efficiency of the real estate industry. Twenty percent of real estate transactions will be made using smart contracts by 2020\n\nReal estate is an industry riddled with inefficiencies. There are huge swaths of the sector—title companies being an area that jumps immediately to mind—that will be greatly reduced and potentially eliminated by the implementation of blockchain-based smart contracts. Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries, which clog up the real estate industry and slow down every transaction. While this is not a good thing if you happen to work in one of the areas that will be affected, it is fantastic for consumers and property owners who are able to cut out functionaries and reduce transaction costs.\n\nWant to learn more about real-estate tech? Discover the best real-estate software in 2019.\n\nImmediately upon completion of a desired and agreed upon task, the contract releases the agreed upon amount of money to the party which has completed the task. The contract, being housed on a blockchain, then creates an immutable transaction record, which contributes to anti-money laundering (AML) efforts and ensures the legitimacy of transactions that are listed on the blockchain.\n\n5. Real-Estate Projects and Blockchain\n\nPrediction: Ten percent of commercial real-estate projects will experience blockchain-driven tokenization by 2020\n\nBlockchain software and applications outside of cryptocurrency will prove their staying power in the financial services industry, and real estate is the industry in which they’ll have the greatest impact. Commercial real estate projects are currently a murky backwater of opaque deals and mounds of indecipherable paperwork. The nature of the industry makes it a haven for money laundering activity and clogs up the flow of doing business, dragging out deals that should take much less time.\n\nBlockchain will bring an abrupt end to the lack of transparency in the industry, specifically commercial-scale projects. By the end of 2019, we will begin to see the first tokenized commercial real estate projects. What this means is that a projects will be divvied up into distributable tokens.\n\nAny exchange involving these tokens, and all transactions relevant to the project, will end up housed on the blockchain. This will create an auditable, immutable record of transactions, introducing transparency to the industry and increasing the ease with which individuals and companies are able to invest in and divest from these projects. Tokenizing projects also makes reallocation of assets easy in case of bankruptcy.\n\n6. Regulatory technology\n\nPrediction: Regulatory technology (regtech) investment in the financial services sector will increase 500% by 2020, from $10.6 billion in 2017 to more than $53 billion\n\nThe investment increase will be driven by the increasing amount of regulatory oversight with regards to fintech as well as the increasing number of regtech solutions allowing large financial institutions to implement tech instead of hiring more compliance employees. Regtech solutions address regulatory reporting, compliance checks, risk management, identity management, and transaction monitoring. The breadth and scope of solutions housed under the regtech umbrella provide financial institutions with a wide range of use cases and potential for efficiency improvement.\n\nRegulation is an inhibiting factor for entrance into the financial services market and costs established companies billions every year as they try to stay within regulations. Regtech, which allows financial services companies to ensure regulatory compliance more easily, including contributing to KYC and AML efforts, will become a staple in the financial services industry by 2020. Currently, 15% of financial institution employees work in compliance. That’s a large chunk of the financial industry’s workforce, and the catalyst is the 500% increase in regulatory changes from 2008–2016 in developed markets.\n\nMultiple large financial institutions are utilizing regtech solutions and seeing significant ROI from those solutions. Rabobank, a large bank headquartered in the Netherlands, had its compliance team implement a risk management solution that reduced 15-minute compliance checks to three minutes. Regtech investment improves operational efficiency in compliance activities, allowing compliance departments to reduce overhead and improve performance. Regtech has proven its value for many financial institutions, and investment in this category of solutions will continue to rise.\n\n7. Blockchain Technology and Financial Inclusion\n\nPrediction: Blockchain technology will open up opportunities for the unbanked or underbanked to gain financial inclusion. The number of unbanked will fall from 1.7 billion to under 1 billion by the end of 2020.\n\nThe large swath of people who will gain financial inclusion will stem from the increased adoption of mobile banking, driven by blockchain implementation. Financial inclusion refers to individuals and businesses having access to financial products and services, such as a bank account, loans, and credit.\n\nAn increase in financial inclusion means an increase in the number of people actively contributing to the transfer and movement of money around the globe, which is a positive. It also means there are more opportunities for financially included individuals and businesses to improve their situations, build and leverage credit for growth opportunities, and more.\n\nThere are massive markets waiting to be tapped by fintech companies looking to expand the number of the financially included. While there may be a degree of altruism driving fintech application development geared towards increasing financial inclusion, the real motivator is the size of the market.\n\nBlockchain pushed fintech into the media spotlight, and blockchain technology will drive mobile banking adoption outside of the high growth areas in which it currently maintains the most market share.\n\nWhile cryptocurrency may never solidify itself as a mainstay in the markets due to its volatility and the uncertainties regarding its viability as a store of value, the underlying technology is applicable. Blockchain, by providing unbanked individuals a verifiable, easily created online identity, will allow more individuals to be financially included than ever before.\n\nReady to learn more about trends in 2019?
