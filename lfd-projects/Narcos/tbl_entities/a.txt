Ok, this looks good. Would need you to run a couple of more things:

1. Basically, run through each row, and match it against all the following words, then if one or more of these words were found in the current row, dump that row in a sheet and dump the found words (comma seperated) in a new column added to the start of the table. The rest of the columns will remain the same as the mother table (only cleaner):

    el sporífero

    drogas

    metanfetamina

    narcóticos

    narca

    cocaína

    el tráfico de drogas

    traficar drogas

    drug dealing

    dealing drugs

    morphine

    Drug

    Drugs

    Drug dealing 

    Narco

    Narco Trafficking 

    Drug trafficking 

    Narcotics

    narcotics traffickers

    Narco-traffickers 

    Opium

    poppy

    narco

    PWID

    opiate

    alcohol	

    ecstasy

    MDMA

    Mephedrone

    meow meow

    Bath Salts

    Drone

    M-CAT

    White Magic

    4-methyl methcathinone 

    4-MMC

    amphetamines

    Methylamphetamine

    crystal meth

    GHB	

    Nicotine

    tobacco

    anabolic steroids

    heroin	

    phencyclidine

    PCP

    benzodiazepines	

    ketamine	

    pregabalin

    buprenorphine	

    psilocybin

    psilocyn

    magic mushrooms

    cannabis

    LSD

    solvents

    Cocaine

    Substance abuse

    Oxycodone

    intoxicated

    Drug abuse

2. Exact same thing as above but:

    Without the added column that carries the name of the match
    Distinct rows (delete all the duplicates)


We're getting somewhere with it.

H.
